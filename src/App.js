        In this laboratory work, I will implement an app which will help to<br/>
        manage your greenhouses. You can add your greenhouse in the app, choose<br/>
        its name, location, and maybe some other properties. Then, you will see<br/>
        some general data about each greenhouse like temperature, humidity, yield etc.
